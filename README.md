# Metro Manila Train Commute App

## Overview
The **Metro Manila Train Commute App** is designed to help commuters plan their trips, view train maps, and search for stations or landmarks along the Metro Manila rail system. The app provides features to simulate travel progress, find routes, and display relevant transit information.

## Core Features

1. **Display Train Map**: 
   - Shows the Metro Manila train lines and stations.

2. **Plan Your Commute**:
   - Users can input a starting station/landmark and a destination to get the best travel route.
   - Supports both direct routes and routes with transfers between different train lines.

3. **Find Landmark or Station**:
   - Search for stations or landmarks by name.
   - Offers fuzzy search results for partial or approximate matches.

4. **Travel Simulation**:
   - Once a route is found, the app simulates the commute by showing the stations and progress in real-time with an interactive progress bar.

## Possible To-Do List
1. **Enhance User Interface**:
   - Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user interaction.
   - Add station and landmark images to improve user experience.

2. **Real-Time Updates**:
   - Integrate real-time data for train schedules and delays.

3. **Save Favorite Routes**:
   - Allow users to save their favorite routes or stations for quick access.

4. **Improve Route Suggestions**:
   - Enhance the route suggestion algorithm to include walking distance between stations and landmarks.

5. **Multilingual Support**:
   - Add language options (e.g., Filipino and English) to cater to a wider audience.

6. **Notifications for Train Closures**:
   - Notify users of unexpected closures or delays on their planned route.

7. **Landmark to Station Finder**:
   - Add functionality to search for stations by entering landmarks.

8. **Progress Bar Redesign**:
   - Revamp the progress bar to provide a smoother and more visually engaging experience during travel simulations.

9. **More Features**:
   - Add other enhancements based on user feedback and ongoing development.

## Known Issues

1. **MRT to LRT Transfer Issue**:
   - The transfer between MRT and LRT lines is not currently working as expected. This feature needs further improvement to ensure smooth transfer point handling between lines.

## Future Improvements
- Populate and update the database with accurate and real-time data.
- Enhance the transfer point logic to handle more complex transfers and routing.
